## Sam's `chezmoi` managed dotfiles

I tried for a while to make a pure NixOS installation. But I've realized that is maybe not for me. So now I have a dotfile repo handled with chezmoi, a cli tool that handles some of the version control and setup of your dotfiles. These setup instructions are both notes for myself and tips on how to recreate my setup, if for some god forsaken reason you want to do that. 


# Setup (WIP)


# Install important packages

Why?
    - `liblua5.1-0-dev`: for [luarocks.nvim](https://github.com/vhyrro/luarocks.nvim)


```bash
sudo apt-get install liblua5.1-0-dev
```
